# Conversate

A Secure post/commenting App. You start by creating a user and an emoji as a profile picture (no login). Then you can either join or create a post room which will generate a password for you to give to people who'd you think are allowed to join your room and start commenting.

The app doesn't require a login, you just select a user name and an image (optional) and then you're all set. However, once you do that your user will be stored in your device as long as you don't clear your data. though you can log out from the room join/create dashboard.
